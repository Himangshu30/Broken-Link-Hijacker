## How it Works

This tool searches for all the INBOUND and OUTBOUND links from HTML tags and then crawls it Further based on the Depness set by the user

Deepness Decide how the Search takes Place on the Webpage
- Deepness = 1
It means that only the given Url will be Crawled
- Deepness=2
In this search, the Crawler goes on Step Further and goes one more level deep to search
- Deepness=3
Here all the INBOUND links from the website are crawled until there is no link left to crawl.
This can take a significant amount of time to complete.
